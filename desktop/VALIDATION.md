The desktop regression uses real pointer and keyboard events and real filesystem/SQLite operations. Native open/save dialogs alone are replaced with predetermined paths in the isolated test profile. Screenshot: `desktop/test-results/desktop.png` (generated, not committed).

Current deliverable is a runnable development milestone, not a signed public release. Follow-up coverage: text/IME, arrows, freehand, frames, image clipboard, library import, stylus/touch, very large boards, Windows installer and full native-feature regression. Scene-area adjustment is implemented by redrawing the region; precision handles are not yet implemented. All remote editor services are disabled.
